# ETECH Romi Workshop 2021
This is one of the FIRST Romi workshops that we've done here at Energy Tech. The Romi workshops are here to educate and prepare the next programmers!
# "Why and how?"
We experiment and play around with these tiny robots known as Romis! Romis work similarly to our bigger (and simply better) robots in FRC, but again, they're very tiny. The "drivetrain" code, which is code telling the robots how to move, are literally and I mean LITERALLY, the exact same thing.
